<h3>Ladies In Lavender</h3>
<br />
<p>
    Where has this movie been all my life? I just found it, and I want to watch it again already. It has love, some comedy, it has very touching moments.</p>
     <br />
    Taking place in pre-World War II England, aging sisters Ursula and Janet live peacefully in their cottage on the shore of Cornwall. One morning following a violent storm, the sisters spot from their garden a nearly-drowned man lying on the beach. They nurse him back to health and discover that he is Polish. Communicating in broken German while they teach him English, they learn his name is Andrea and that he is a particularly gifted violinist. His boat was on its way to America, where he is headed to look for a better life. It doesn't take long for them to become attached to Andrea, and they dote on him. Other townspeople, however, have their suspicions, especially when he befriends a Russian woman, Olga.</p>

    <h3>My Life In Ruins</h3>
    <br />
    <p>This is a rom com with it all. Shot in beautiful Greece, there is love and comedy amid the great ruins of Greece. The characters are as diverse as you might expect on a guided tour.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Georgia (Nia Vardalos), a travel guide, feels that her life as no direction. Her kefi, or mojo, is gone. But, as she leads a ragtag group of tourists through her native Greece, she begins to see the world in a new light. Georgia opens the group's eyes to the beauty of an exotic land, and, in the process, rediscovers her kefi.</p>

    <h3>This is a 3 for the price of 1!</h3>
    <h4>All three My Big Fat Greek Wedding movies</h4>
    <br />
    <p>Our first movie in the series is, of course, My Big Fat Greek Wedding. This is almost more com than rom.</p>
    <p>
        Everyone in the Portokalos family worries about Toula (Nia Vardalos). Still unmarried at 30 years old, she works at Dancing Zorba's, the Greek restaurant owned by her parents, Gus (Michael Constantine) and Maria (Lainie Kazan). After taking a job at her aunt's travel agency, she falls in love with Ian Miller (John Corbett), a teacher who is tall, handsome and definitely not Greek. Toula isn't sure which will be more upsetting to her father, that Ian is a foreigner or that he's a vegetarian</p>
        <br />
        <p>The second movie in the series adds a grown daughter, one heading off to college, a family secret, and the mandatory comedy.</p>
        <p>Parenting and marriage is becoming tougher and tougher for Toula (Nia Vardalos) and her husband Ian. Not only has their relationship lost some of its spark, but they're also dealing with a rebellious teenage daughter who clashes with Greek traditions. On top of that, Toula must contend with aging parents and the endless needs of cousins and friends. When a shocking family secret comes to light, the entire Portokalos clan makes plans to come together for an even bigger wedding than before.</p>
        <br />
        <p>You can't watch the first two and not watch the third in the series. I had to leave my small town to go see this on the big screen. Well worth it, and I experienced my first mega theater, with a bowling alley and restaurants, where they bring the food to your table in the theater. This one was shot in Greece, as opposed to the first two movies in the series. Gorgeous views, comedy, a family scandal, a forbidden love, and a quirky mayor.</p>
        <p>Being half Greek (my dad was born there), I couldn't skip these movies.</p>
        <p>From writer and director Nia Vardalos, the worldwide phenomenon My Big Fat Greek Wedding is back with a brand-new adventure. Join the Portokalos family as they travel to a family reunion in Greece for a heartwarming and hilarious trip full of love, twists and turns. Opa!</p>
