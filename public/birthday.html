<h3>What to bring</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A dog cookie, pretty please</li>
    <li>Some bubbles, for us to chase</li>
    <li>An empty tummy, because Mommy will get us cheeseburgers, and fries!</li>
    <li>A toy that won't fall apart when I chew on it</li>
    <li>A lap for me to sit in</li>
    <li>Big smiles, because I am going to be a decade old</li>
</ul>

Don't forget, it's a really big day. I need cuddles, and "good boys", and a belly rub. 

Just in case you forgot where I live, Mommy is including the directions <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/108+Farm+to+Market+Rd+1821,+Mineral+Wells,+TX+76067/@32.8117136,-98.0849893,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x8651f5842d07dc3b:0xf34f7b880055123d!8m2!3d32.8117091!4d-98.0824144!16s%2Fg%2F11bw41y5pr?entry=ttu" </a> here.
