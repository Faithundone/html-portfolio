    <p>The class clown had few options. He chose the Army. Having been excited about building a radio
        in class at school, he chose Radio Repairman. Good choice. Then one night at work, there was a 
        computer issue. He stayed up all ngiht, but he got it up and running. (Electronics are grand, until they break down. )
