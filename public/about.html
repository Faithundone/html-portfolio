<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Thank you for stopping in. I was born in Indiana, and found myself living in Texas, about half my life now. I am a mom, a follower of Christ, a lover of animals, curious, in a quest for knowledge, and in no hurry to retire. 
  </p>

<p>I started out in Avon, Indiana, a place with nothing much to speak of. We had our own schools, a Tops store, and a Dairy Queen (and we never ate there). My dad had a pizza parlor a short walk from the Speedway track. A treat was White Castle hamburgers after the pizza parlor closed. Daddy wasn't into fast food. He wasn't raised on it. No burger joints in Thessaloniki, Greece. Life was small. We lived off a highway, and venturing from our small subdivision was not advised. I grew up with the same children and neighbors aside from a family moving into a duplex in our neighborhood. </p>

<p>Life got even smaller when my parents bought a farm. Now we were really isolated. For awhile there was only a girl who visited her grandparents on many weekends, and the 2 girls next door, who were much younger. But, isolation had its perks. The new neighbors had a pony, who was too much for their older daughter. She was several years younger than me, and Poki was a handful. That wicked gal taught me a lot. We had Angus, fresh air, a dried out manure pile to play King of the Hill, and a creek in the summer. And I went to a new school, and there I met Wanda Burkhart. Her neighbor took gymnastics, and while I was limited to cartwheels, Wanda had hand-me-down lessons, which she gladly shared with me. We were doing cartwheels and walkovers off the bleachers. </p>

<p>Life was good, but it was to change. My parents split up, mom whisking us away while dad was at the pizza parlor. My small life became very big, and a bit scary. We moved in with my uncle, who lived in the middle of Indianapolis. Sure, I had been there. But I had never lived there. I could take the bus to a huge library, grab a Roselyn's brownie while I waited for the return bus, and I did it all on my own. I was 13 years old before I ever ventured that far from home by myself. </p>

<p>I spent half my life in Indiana before moving to Texas. This isn't my last stop, but the changes were easier than I thought. I don't really miss the snow. If you haven't had the joy of being the one to push a car stuck in the snow, I guess you haven't really lived. I would be fine never seeing another snowflake outside of a photograph. I have not seen nearly enough of Texas, but I did get to see some lovely places while I was delivering cars. I have had a varied work history, mostly factory work. I love producing things. Just that now, they aren't going to be things you can hold physically.  </p>

<p>As of this writing, I have not finished the page to my brother. He was a great guy. Joined the Army, got to see the world, was very blessed to find an amazing wife on his first station. He was in communications, having loved builiding his first radio in class at WEBO. But as soon as they needed immediate help getting a computer up and running, George became their guy. My experience with computers was more casual. I tried to build a website, picking up information from various websites. That was a slow process. I was good at virus eradication, and swapping out hardware. </p> 

<p>And now, it's time to get serious. I've found a course in Web Development, and one in Python. I am not ready to start quite yet, but I do have one for Java. When I tackle Java, I will take on JSON. </p>

<p>For now, I work with AI. It is a nice job to have. I will use my skills at that job, and also in others. I still have a lot of life left, and I plan to make the most of it. </p>
